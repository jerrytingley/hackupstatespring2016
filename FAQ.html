          <li>Is this open source?
            <ul>
              <li>Yes! You can find the source<a href="https://github.com/jerrytingley/hackupstatespring2016" alt="The Source"> on our Github Repo</a>.</li>

          <li>This page loads really fast. Why is that?
              <ul>
                <li>This site was built so even those with older or slower machines could still use it. For that reason Edward Deaver made a custom minimalistic CSS grid framework for this. Also Jerry Tingely's python being server side helped a lot!</li>
